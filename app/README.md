A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

2. Run Seeds `bin/bake migrations seed`.

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.
